# Bayesian Imputation for Multivariate Left-Censored Data

This repository contains the main code for the paper:

*A Bayesian Parametric and Nonparametric Approach for the Imputation of Multivariate Left-Censored Data due to Limit of Detection*  
by Federico L. Perlino, Bernardo Nipoti, Paige Williams, and Andrea Bellavia.

The paper is currently under review at *Statistics in Medicine*.

### Files
- `MI_Models.R`: Implements the core imputation models — the multivariate normal multiple imputation model and the location-only Dirichlet Process Mixture Model — for handling multivariate data affected by the limit of detection.
- `Standard_Prior_Elicitation.R`: Contains prior specification tools as described in the paper.
- `Toy_Example.R`: A minimal working example using synthetic data to illustrate model application.

We will update the code with more tools as they become available.  
Please check out this repository and stay tuned!
